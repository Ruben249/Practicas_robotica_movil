### Practice 1
#### Start
The first day we started learning the basic knowledge of the robot and its sensors. We learned how the laser works, how to use the information it gives us, how to tell if it has crashed, how to make it move forward and backward, and how to make it spin.

#### Development
I continued developing the code, and managed to make it move randomly a few times, but I ran into the problem that it got stuck in the corner, as seen in this photo ![Foto 2](https://github.com/Ruben249/practicas_robotica_movil/assets/102288264/f8d04b4a-32e3-41e9-8d9b-d2ca34269ef1)
I perfected it a little, making it turn more to one side than the other and making it so that if it collided in the center it would turn randomly to one side or the other, as seen in this photo ![Foto 3](https://github.com/Ruben249/practicas_robotica_movil/assets/102288264/ee905959-6861-40f6-9f34-05bb06b9a556)
In the next photo we see how the robot has greater self-sufficiency to get out of small holes and places where it was previously trapped

Finally, I thought that in order to get out of corners, the robot would have to make random turns, so I decided that every time it turned it would do it differently, and this is the result:

Here is a sped-up X3 video where we briefly see how the robot behaves.
